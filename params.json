It is supported by the Portuguese **Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)** and by the **Brazilian foundation Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES)**.\r\n\r\n# How to use CloudSim++\r\nCloudSim++ is a Maven project with some modules. The easier way to use the project is relying on some IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.\r\nBut if you want just take a look of how it works or you are a such terminal guy, the sub-sections below show the instructions.\r\n\r\nConsidering that you have [git](https://git-scm.com) and [maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed on you operating system, you have to first download the project source by cloning the repositosy using the following command at a terminal `git clone https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus.git` or you can just use the download button at this page. \r\n\r\nAfter downloading the project, you have to use a terminal to enter in the project directory. Now, choose one of the ways below to use the project.\r\n\r\n## By means of comnand line (the faster way to see how it works)\r\nThere is a  [bash script](script/bootstrap.sh) that you can use to build and run CloudSim++ examples. The script must be run on the project root directory in a Unix-like system such as Linux, FreeBDS and Mac OSX.\r\n\r\nTo run some example type the command: `sh script/bootstrap.sh ExampleClassName`.\r\nFor instance, to run the CloudSimExample1 you can type: `sh script/bootstrap.sh CloudSimExample1`. \r\nTo run an example into a sub-directory, type `sh script/bootstrap.sh sub_directory_name.ExampleClassName`.\r\nFor instance, to run the [workload/SwfWorkloadFormatExample1](modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/workload/SwfWorkloadFormatExample1.java) example, type `sh script/bootstrap.sh workload.SwfWorkloadFormatExample1`.\r\n\r\nThe script checks if it is required to build the project and uses maven in this case, that will make sure to download all dependencies. To see what examples are available, just navigate through the [examples directory](modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples).\r\n\r\nTo just build the CloudSim++ and examples packages, execute the script without any parameter.  \r\n \r\n## By means of an IDE (the easier way to create your own simulations)\r\nThe easier way to use the project is relying on some IDE such as NetBeans, Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.\r\nBelow are the steps to start using the project:\r\n\r\n- Using a terminal, clone the project to a folder in your computer: `git clone https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus.git`\r\n- Open/import the project in your IDE:\r\n    - For [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org), just use the \"Open project\" menu and select the directory where the project was cloned.\r\n    - For [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) or [IntelliJ IDEA](http://jetbrains.com/idea/), you have to import the project selecting the folder where the project was cloned. \r\n- Inside the opened/imported project you will have the cloudsim and cloudsim-examples modules under the modules directory. The cloudsim module is where the simulator source code is, that usually you don't have to change, unless you want to contribute to the project. The cloudsim-examples is where you can start.\r\n- Open the cloudsim-examples module. The most basic examples are in the org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples package. You can run each one of the classes in this package to get a different example. \r\n- If you want to build your own simulations, the easiest way is to create another class inside this module.\r\n\r\n# A minimal simulation example\r\n\r\nThe construction of a scenario to simulate the infrastructure of a Cloud provider is not so minimal. In order to build such a simulation scenario you have to create, at least: \r\n- a datacenter with a list of physical machines (Hosts); \r\n- a broker that is accountable for submission of VMs and Cloudlets to be executed, on behalf of a given customer, into the cloud infrastructure; \r\n- a list of customer's virtual machines (VMs); \r\n- and a list of customer's cloudlets (objects that model resource requirements of a given application).\r\n\r\nBy this way, the main code used to build such a simulation scenario can be as below. This is simply the code of the constructor method. The complete example is available at the cloudsim-examples module [here](modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/MinimalExample.java).\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthis.vmList = new ArrayList<>();\r\nthis.cloudletList = new ArrayList<>();\r\nint numberOfCloudUsers = 1; //number of cloud customers\r\nboolean traceEvents = false;\r\n\r\nCloudSim.init(numberOfCloudUsers, Calendar.getInstance(), traceEvents);\r\n\r\nDatacenter datacenter0 = createDatacenter(\"Datacenter0\");\r\n\r\n/*Creates a Broker accountable for submission of VMs and Cloudlets\r\non behalf of a given cloud user (customer).*/\r\nDatacenterBroker broker0 = new DatacenterBrokerSimple(\"Broker0\");\r\n\r\nVm vm0 = createVm(broker0);\r\nthis.vmList.add(vm0);\r\nbroker0.submitVmList(vmList);\r\n\r\nCloudlet cloudlet0 = createCloudlet(broker0, vm0);\r\nthis.cloudletList.add(cloudlet0);\r\nbroker0.submitCloudletList(cloudletList);\r\n\r\n//Starts the simulation and waits all tasks to be executed\r\nCloudSim.startSimulation();\r\n\r\n//Finishes the simulation\r\nCloudSim.stopSimulation();\r\n\r\n/*Prints results when simulation is over\r\n(you can use your own code here to print what you want from this cloudlet list)*/\r\nList<Cloudlet> finishedCloudlets = broker0.getCloudletsFinishedList();\r\nCloudletsTableBuilderHelper.print(new TextTableBuilder(), finishedCloudlets);\r\nLog.printFormattedLine(\"Minimal Example finished!\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nThe project documentation originated from CloudSim was entirely updated and extended. \r\nYou can see the javadoc documentation for classes and their elements directly on your IDE.\r\nThe documentation is also available online at <http://cloudsimplus.org/docs/> \r\n\r\n# Why should I care about this CloudSim fork? I just want to build my simulations. :neutral_face:\r\n\r\nWell, the design of the tool has a direct impact when you need to extend it to include some feature for your simulations. The simulator provides a set of classes such as Vm Schedulers, Cloudlet Schedulers, Vm Allocation Policies, Resource Provisioners, Utilization Models, Power Models and Datacenter Brokers that implement basic algorithms for every one of these  features. For instance, the `VmAllocationPolicySimple` class implements a Worst Fit\r\npolicy that selects the PM wich less processor cores in use to host the VM, and in fact it is the only policy available. \r\n\r\nUsually you have to perform your own implementations of these features, such as a Best Fit VM allocation policy, a resource Utilization Model with an upper threshold or a Datacenter Broker that selects the best Datacenter to submit a VM.\r\n\r\nConsidering that, several software engineering principles aim to ease the task of creating  new classes to implement those features. They also try to avoid forcing you to change  core classes of the simulator in order to introduce a feature you need to implement.\r\nChanging these core classes is a bad practice, once you will not be able to automatically update your  project to new versions of the simulator without losing your changes or struggle to fix merge conficts.  \r\n\r\nAnd as I have seen in the forums that I've attended, many times users have to perform these changes in core classes just to implement some specific features they need. By this way, I think those problems are enough reasons that show the need of a new reengineered version of the simulator.  \r\n\r\n# But why another CloudSim fork? :unamused:\r\n\r\nI know what you are thinking: it would be better to pull a request to the original CloudSim repository in order to really contribute to the project, benefiting everybody.\r\n\r\nWell, I strongly agree with you and in fact I tried that. However, the original CloudSim moved on to a new major release, including a completely new set of classes to provide Container as a Service simulations, before the changes proposed here being merged to the official repository. The huge amount of contributions of CloudSim++ are discussed in the section below. \r\nBy this way, all the work performed here was not incorporated to allow the new features to be developed using this redesigned version.\r\nAnd unfortunately, there are several months of hard work that would need to be replicated in order to merge both projects.\r\n\r\n# OK, but I'm just wondering what are the real contributions of CloudSim++ :blush:\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a huge amount of changes that makes CloudSim++ **NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE** with original CloudSim. However, to port your CloudSim simulations to CloudSim++ can be relatively easy, as it will be presented further. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the main contributions of CloudSim++ are:\r\n\r\n- Improved class hierarchy and code that is easier to understand\r\n- Reusable and standards conforming code\r\n- Improved documentation\r\n- Completely new Test Suites\r\n- New set of features\r\n- New examples for old and new features\r\n- Update to Java 8\r\n\r\nAll these improvements are described in details in the next sub-sections. \r\n\r\n## Improved class hierarchy and code that is easier to understand\r\n\r\n- **Classes were moved to new meangnifull packages in order to ease the process of finding a class that represents a given behaviour that you want to use or extend**. Some new packages are:\r\n  \t- [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.allocationpolicies](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/allocationpolicies) for VmAllocationPolicy classes that define how a PM is selected to host a VM.\r\n  \t- [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.brokers](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/brokers) for DatacenterBroker classes that defines the policies for submission of customer VMs and cloudlets.\r\n  \t- [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.resources](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/resources) for resources such as CPU cores (Processor Elements - PEs), RAM, Hard Drive Storage, SAN Storage, etc.\r\n  \t- [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.schedulers](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/schedulers) for VmScheduler and CloudletScheduler classes that defines how the execution of cloudlets and VMs are scheduled in the processor.\r\n  \t- [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.utilizationmodels](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/utilizationmodels) for UtilizationModel classes that define how a cloudlet uses physical resources.\r\n- **More meaningful class and method names to provide clear understanding of the responsiblity of each one**: usually you have to look at classes and their methods to figure out if there is a feature you want to use. Not rarely you have to go through the documentation to understand what is the responsibility of a given class or method. Using more specific and clear names frequently makes you to instantaneously find out what is the method or class you need. It thus relieves you to read the documentation to start coding (*despite it is really important to read the documentation,\r\nsometimes you don't have time to go through the details*).\r\n\r\n## Reusable and standards conforming code\r\n\r\n- **Cleaner code that is easier to understand, maintain and test**: a cleaner, clear, well organized code that always follows the same code standards and formatting is easier to understand. And talking about an open source project, the best way to understand how the software works and how you can extend it is reading the source code. If is follows the [clean code](http://cleancoder.com) practice, [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), it will be easier to understand.\r\n- **Division of very long and confuse methods into small, clean and very meaningful ones that usually makes just one thing**: when using the approach of reading the code to understand how it works, it is very difficult to figure out what is happening into a method with dozens or hundreds lines. And I'm not even talking about the problems to maintain such methods. Thus, little methods with just one responsibility and with meangniful names are easier to maintain. Further, they improve reuse and extension, the most important parts for you that are creating cloud simulations.\r\n- **Improved class hierarchy in order to follow the [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle) and increased reausability and facility for extension, following the [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle)****: the ISP states that [\"no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle#cite_note-ASD-1) and the OCP states that [\"software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle#cite_note-1). These principles together impacts directly developers that need to extend some simulator class to implement a desired behaviour (such as a specific CloudletScheduler). The ISP preach that you should have a great number of small classes following the [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) instead of a small set of big classes. By this way, if you need to extend a given behaviour, usually you will have to extend a specific and little class, that has less code for you to worry about. By the other hand, the OCP relieves you of changing simulator classes to include a desired behaviour. Thus, it focuses on trying to give you the serenity to change just your code. \r\n- **Both use of OCP and ISP to try to avoid changing base classes to include some new behaviour\r\n  and the bad [copy-and-paste anti-pattern](https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns/cut-and-paste-programming)**: copy-and-paste is a bad practice that degrades the source code along the time. It makes difficulty to correct bugs when there may be several copies of the problematic code. The duplicated code has to be tested several times, what usually leads to neglecting them. Further, along the time, the number of duplicated just increases. \r\n\r\n## Improved documentation\r\n\r\n- **Entirely documentation review and update**, improving explanation of classes and method responsibilities, fixing issues, correcting broken links, updating documentation that didn't reflect methods and class's responsibility anymore.\r\n- **Documentation extension** to make clear key points of classes or methods.\r\n- **Removal of duplicated documentation** that just gets out-of-date along the time. Now, subclasses that had documentation copied from the super class, just inherit the documentation of extends it using the javadoc [@inheritdoc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/javadoc.html#inheritingcomments) tag.\r\n- **Inclusion of some missing documentation** or documentation that just repeated the name of a method or attribute. For instance \"This is the id\", doesn't help in anything.\r\n\r\n## Completely new Test Suites\r\n\r\nThe original CloudSim already has some unit test suites, however, there isn't coverage reports enabled in the project. After enabling these reports, it was realized that just 20% of the code was being covered by unit tests. Tests are really important to try ensuring that the software works as expected and gives more security and peace of mind to refactor the code, perform changes and fix bugs :pray:. \r\nAfter all, a broad code coverage also tries to ensure that you are getting accurate results from your simulations.\r\n\r\nFinally, an entire simulation is very complex, integrating several classes that communicate among themselves. Once, unit tests just check\r\nisolated method calls, integration/functional tests are required to validate entire simulation scenarios.\r\nThis project introduces a set of such tests into the simulator in order to increase simulation accuracy.\r\nThus, the contributions in this area are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Functional/integration tests using JUnit to test how a set of classes works together and even overall simulation scenarios.\r\n- Continuous integration using [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) services (see the badge at the top of this file).\r\n- Inclusion of Maven Coverage Plugin to starting tracking the percentage of code that is being coverage by unit tests.\r\n- Inclusion of public code coverage report using [Coveralls](http://coveralls.io) services (see the badge at the top of this file). The code coverage raised from 20% to [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus?branch=master).\r\n- Bug fixes.\r\n\r\n## New set of features\r\n\r\nSome totally new features were introduced in CloudSim++:\r\n\r\n- **A TableBuilder interface and a set of implementing classes to automate the process of printing simulation results in different formats such as Text (ASCII), CSV and HTML**: the interface and classes are available at the [util](/modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/util/) package. To print results of a list of executed cloudlet you can use a single line of code such as `CloudletsTableBuilderHelper.print(new TextTableBuilder(), broker.getCloudletsFinishedList());`. All the perfectly aligned tables that you will see after running the examples uses the TextTableBuilder class.\r\n- **Listener objects that allow you to be notified when different events happen during your simulation execution**: the interfaces and classes included in the [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.listeners](/modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/listeners/) package allow you to keep an eye in your simulation execution and perform additional tasks when a given event happens. These listeners were implemented in some CloudSim++ classes such as below (the next section describes examples of this feature):\r\n    - CloudSim: to notify observers when any event is processed on CloudSim.      \r\n    - Host: to notify observers when VMs processing is updated.\r\n    - Vm: to notify observers when a host is allocated to a VM, a host is deallocated for a VM, the creation of a VM failed. \r\n    - Cloudlet: to notify observers when a cloudlet finishes executing.\r\n- **A set of builder classes to automate to process of creating multiple simulation objects such as Datacenters, Hosts, VMs and Cloudlets**: [builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) is a design pattern used to ease the creation of objects. As several simulations require the developer to create multiple instances of a given object with the same attribute values (such as several identical hosts), this starts being a repetitive, time-consuming and boring task. The package [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.builders](/modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/builders/) provide a set of classes to enable the automation of this instantiation process. The class [SimulationScenarioBuilder](/modules/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/builders/SimulationScenarioBuilder.java) is the start point to access all the introduced builders. New examples were not included yet, but the [Integration Tests package](modules/cloudsim-plus/src/test/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/IntegrationTests/) makes intensive use of this new feature.\r\n\r\n## New examples for old and new features\r\n\r\nNew concise and easy to understand examples of features that have lots of questions at forums were included, such as:\r\n- [Dynamic creation of cloudlets based on workload traces](modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/workload/) - the example dynamically create cloudlets according to the data of a workload trace file. VMs are created to fulfil cloudlets' requirements and, in its turn, Hosts are created to fulfil VMs' requirements. It may not represent a real world use case, but the example can be adapted to developer needs.  \r\n- [VM migration](/modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/migration/) - the example performs VM migrations based on Host utilization threshold. \r\n- Implementation of custom DatacenterBroker and VmAllocationPolicy for the given examples.\r\n- Examples using the new Listener features were included to the package [org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples.listeners](modules/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/listeners/).\r\n\r\n## Update to Java 8\r\n\r\nThe [cloudsim module](modules/cloudsim), that represents the Cloud Simulation API, now requires the JDK 8 and makes intensive use of [Lambda Expressions, Streams and Functional Programming](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html) of the Java 8. However, [cloudsim-examples](modules/cloudsim-examples) project was updated just from Java 6 to 7 aiming to provide yet simple examples for beginner Java programmers, but less verbose code than Java 6.\r\n\r\nThe amazing Java 8 features allow developers to drastically reduce the number of lines to implement basic features such as iteration, filtering,\r\nsorting and processing lists, as well as reducing the number of [boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) required \r\njust to use classes having a single method.\r\n\r\nFor instance, see the code below to create a Thread in Java 7:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nRunnable task1 = \r\n    new Runnable(){\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void run() {\r\n            //Your code to be run by the thread\r\n        }\r\n    };     \r\n        \r\nnew Thread(task1).start();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Java 8 you can just write:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew Thread(() -> {\r\n    //Your code to be run by the thread\r\n}).start();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe iteration over lists now can be performed easily using the stream API. The example below uses a single line of code to iterate over a list of cloudlets, binding every one to a specific VM.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncloudletList.forEach(cloudlet -> broker.bindCloudletToVm(cloudlet.getId(), vm.getId()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the code clearer to understand and less verbose. Further, the new Stream API provides a complete set of features that even increase performance, such as allowing the [parallel processing of lists](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html#section5).\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information about the changes and features included in this release, please read the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file and the [cloudsim-examples](modules/cloudsim-examples) project.\r\n\r\n# What are the practical differences of using CloudSim++ instead of CloudSim? How can I update my simulations in order to use CloudSim++?\r\n\r\nTo update your simulations to use the new CloudSim++ you have to change the way that some objects are instantiated, because \r\nthere were introduced some new interfaces to follow the \"program to an interface, not an implementation\" recommendation and also to increase [abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)). These new interfaces were also crucial to implement the [Null Object Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) in order to try avoiding NullPointerException's.\r\n\r\nBy this way, the classes Datacenter, DatacenterCharacteristics, Host, Pe, Vm and Cloudlet were renamed due to the introduction of interfaces with these names. Now all these classes have a suffix *Simple* (as already defined for some previous classes such as PeProvisionerSimple and VmAllocationPolicySimple). For instance, to instantiate a Cloudlet you have to execute a code such as:\r\n\r\n ```java\r\nCloudletSimple cloudlet = new CloudletSimple(required, parameters, here);\r\n```   \r\n\r\nHowever, once these interfaces were introduced in order to also enable the creation of different cloudlet classes, the recommendation is to declare your object using the interface, not the class: \r\n \r\n ```java\r\nCloudlet cloudlet = new CloudletSimple(required, parameters, here);\r\n```   \r\n\r\nOnce the packages were reorganized, you have to adjust them. However, use your IDE to adjust the imports.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the interface Storage was renamed to FileStorage and its implementations are SanStorage and HarddriveStorage, that can be used as before.\r\nFinally, the way you instantiate a host has changed too. There aren't the classes RamProvisionerSimple and BwProvisionerSimple anymore. \r\nNow you just have the generic class ResourceProvisionerSimple. And this class doesn't requires a primitive value to define the resource capacity.\r\nInstead, it requires an object that implements the new Resource interface (such as the Ram and Bandwidth classes). By this way, to instantiate a host you can use a code such as below:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nint ram = 20480;\r\nlong bw = 1000000;\r\nlong storage = 1000000;\r\nHost host = new HostSimple(id,\r\n        new ResourceProvisionerSimple<>(new Ram(ram)),\r\n        new ResourceProvisionerSimple<>(new Bandwidth(bw)),\r\n        storage, peList, new VmSchedulerTimeShared(peList));\r\n``` \r\n\r\n# Cloud Computing Simulations\r\n\r\nCloud computing is the leading technology for delivery of reliable, secure, fault-tolerant, sustainable, and scalable computational services.\r\n\r\nFor assurance of such characteristics in cloud systems under development, it is required timely, repeatable, and controllable methodologies for evaluation of new cloud applications and policies before actual development of cloud products. Because utilization of real testbeds limits the experiments to the scale of the testbed and makes the reproduction of results an extremely difficult undertaking, simulation may be used.\r\n\r\nCloudSim goal is to provide a generalized and extensible simulation framework that enables modeling, simulation, and experimentation of emerging Cloud computing infrastructures and application services, allowing its users to focus on specific system design issues that they want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.\r\n\r\nThe original CloudSim version is developed in [the Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems (CLOUDS) Laboratory](http://cloudbus.org/), at [the Computer Science and Software Engineering Department](http://www.csse.unimelb.edu.au/) of [the University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/).\r\n\r\n# Main features of the simulator\r\n\r\n  * support for modeling and simulation of large scale Cloud computing data centers\r\n  * support for modeling and simulation of virtualized server hosts, with customizable policies for provisioning host resources to virtual machines\r\n  * support for modeling and simulation of energy-aware computational resources\r\n  * support for modeling and simulation of data center network topologies and message-passing applications\r\n  * support for modeling and simulation of federated clouds\r\n  * support for dynamic insertion of simulation elements, stop and resume of simulation\r\n  * support for user-defined policies for allocation of hosts to virtual machines and policies for allocation of host resources to virtual machines\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\nThe download package contains all the source code, examples, jars, and API html files.\r\n\r\n# Publications about the original CloudSim version\r\n\r\n  * Anton Beloglazov, and Rajkumar Buyya, [Optimal Online Deterministic Algorithms and Adaptive Heuristics for Energy and Performance Efficient Dynamic Consolidation of Virtual Machines in Cloud Data Centers](http://beloglazov.info/papers/2012-optimal-algorithms-ccpe.pdf), Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, Volume 24, Number 13, Pages: 1397-1420, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, New York, USA, 2012.\r\n  * Saurabh Kumar Garg and Rajkumar Buyya, [NetworkCloudSim: Modelling Parallel Applications in Cloud Simulations](http://www.cloudbus.org/papers/NetworkCloudSim2011.pdf), Proceedings of the 4th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2011, IEEE CS Press, USA), Melbourne, Australia, December 5-7, 2011.\r\n  * **Rodrigo N.
