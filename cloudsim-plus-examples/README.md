# CloudSim Plus Examples

This module contains the old CloudSim examples, that were updated to use CloudSim Plus and went through refactoring, re-organization and documentation update.
Several new CloudSim Plus examples for exclusive features are available into the [org.cloudsimplus.examples](src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples) package.
They have more meaningful names, making it easier to get an overview of what an example is about, before even opening it.
